# Core Features

Radica authentication system allows to:

- **Decentralization**: The certificates are stored on the Blockchain, making them immutable and decentralized. Most importantly, the certificates are accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, without relying on third parties.
- **Easy Verification**: The verification process is easy and fast. The user only needs to scan the NFC tag with the mobile application to verify the authenticity of the product. No wallet or user action are required.
- **Extensible**: The system is designed to be extensible to benefit of all the Blockchain advantages. A practical example is the possibility to also give the owner of the product the NFC associated to it in order to demonstrate onwership. More on this [here](//link to RadicaPropery docs).
