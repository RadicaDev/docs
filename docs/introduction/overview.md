# Overview

**Radica** is a project that allows to certify and authenticate products in the most secure and decentralized way possible. It relies on NFC to authenticate products and Blockchain to certify them.

## Key Features

- **Secure**: Radica uses last generation NFC tags and Blockchain technology to provide the highest level of security.
- **Easy to use**: Radica is designed to be easy to use for both the end user and the manufacturer.

Radica aims to solve the problem of verifying the authenticity of a product with Blockchain without making the owner an active participant in the process. This is achieved by creating a **direct link** between a physical product and the Blockchain.
